      <h3>Hi there, I'm Cristina.</h3>
      <p>I'm a Full-stack developer and I love to create new stuff.
        I have about 2 years of work experience and I plan on growing in the years to come.</p>
      <p>I'm hard working and love working on projects, as individual or in a team, big or small, especially when they push me to my limits.</p>
      <p>If I'm not in front of the screen you can find me outside hiking on mountain peaks or in the ocean catching some waves.</p>
      <br><p>Want to talk about coding or anything else?!</p>
      <p>Let's get in touch!</p>
